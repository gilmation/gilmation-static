  desc2: "The Angus is <a href=\"https://the-angus.co.uk/\">a unique Scottish golf development opportunity</a> which has been created by Mike Forbes and Darren Clarke. In order to present the project online in a way that complemented the beautiful brochure, plans and other materials that Mike and Darren had produced we were required to work closely with these materials in order to be able to translate them effectively into The Angus website."

- client1: "Scottish LBTT and ADS Range Calculator"
  desc1: "When buying a property in Scotland it is necessary to pay at least one tax that varies according to the price paid for the property. While there are some online calculators available none of them allow you to see how the taxes change across a range of purchase prices. As a result building our own <a href=\"https://lbtt-scotland.co.uk/\">LBTT and ADS calculator</a> for a range of purchase prices was a classic case of scratching our own itch. We used Ember for the front-end application and built and configured the hosting environment with <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\">Terraform.</a>"

  client2: "BawBags"
  desc2: "<a href=\"https://www.bawbags.com/\">BawBags</a> is a Scottish undergarment brand and we have recently begun to assist their team in gaining a greater understanding of their online retail business. Our starting point was to perform a comprehensive review of the current BawBags IT infrastructure - one of the main aims of which was to make sure that certain key measurements were in place. It was fundamental that these measurements were in place and that their generation was automated (using principally the scripting integration between Google Docs and Google Analytics / Google Adwords) before any changes were made, as you can't improve what you can't measure."

  client2: "Alliance Connect - Littljohns"
  desc2: "We developed, hosted and supported the Littlejohns' website and property upload application, that we built for them back at the end of 2010, for over 6 years. As the property export / upload capabilities of the CARL system (that Littlejohns used internally to manage the thousands of properties that they have on their books) evolved, it became evident that the time had come to incorporate these changes into our existing system."

  desc1: "DigitalDudz is an American based company which was acquired by AFG Media in April 2013. In it's previous incarnation the company was run by Mark Rober in his spare time while he worked for NASA as an engineer. As you'll be able to see from his youtube channel he is a very creative guy (with more than 15 million views he seems to be popular too!) who had come up with a really fun and interesting idea for incorporating smart phones (animations) into t-shirts."

  client2: "Morphsuits Web Development and Design"
  desc2: "Morphsuits aspired to be one of the most recognisable fancy dress brands in the world. Hugh began working with AFG Media, the company behind Morphsuits, back in October 2010 when they were looking at transitioning their infrastructure from an online e-commerce provider to their own custom solution. This was in large part due to the growth that the business was experiencing and the changing requirements that were a result of this. At that time there were 13 different Morphsuits sites each of which had a separate back-end and served a different region of the world."

  desc1: "On this project we worked with the team from London Scottish from the conception of the product through to the design and development of a marketing and sales website which promoted and sold memberships of London Scottish for friends of the club based in North America. Our experience of product configuration, warehousing and distribution channels in North America was put to good use over the course of a few weeks as we assisted London Scottish's marketing team in their negotiations with a number of North American providers. The final product that we produced was effectively a single product (a single season membership, membership card and membership pin), which was sold in a single currency (USD) and distributed in North America."

  client2: "Littlejohns Property"
  desc2: "Littlejohns are one of Edinburgh's longest established and best residential property management companies. They had become tired with their previous website which consisted of a basic and extremely limited content management system which was used to run a rigid fixed width website. They wanted to make the move to a new website architecture that would allow them to easily update existing content, create and publish new content as well as display a searchable listing of the properties which were currently available for let."

- client1: "DUOK - Audit"
  desc1: "DUOK has a number of legacy web based applications which service requests with PHP scripts. Since these typically contain a mixture of different types of logic (presentation, business, database, etc) as the years have passed and the applications have evolved it has become increasingly expensive to maintain them or to add new features. Our objective for this collaboration was to review current development practices and the proposed future application architecture to identify any areas that could be improved and then give whatever \"hands on\" support was needed."

  client2: "GIE - External Data"
  desc2: "The development of External Data complements the work that we are doing on Ikasys with the team at GIE (Gipuzkoako Ikastolen Elkartea). Prior to the completion of the External Data system Ikasys (more specifically Trainer and Inspector) needed to extract details about the academic structure, students and teachers from some type of external education centre management system. External Data provides an implementation of this system which frees Ikasys from it's only dependency on a 3rd party system."
