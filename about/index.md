    <h3>Hugh Gilmour</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="pure-u-1 block">
     <h4>Background</h4>
     <p>Hugh began working in software development with Sun Microsystems in 2000, where he developed and supported mission critical systems for the high-end server production line, back in the days of Java 1.1 and the first specifications of J2EE.
     In the summer of 2003 he left Sun, did the Cambridge University CELTA and moved to Valencia, Spain. After a 10 month spell working as an English teacher and teaching himself Spanish he got back into software development with GFT.
     Over the course of the next 3 years he worked as a technical lead / architect with Spanish teams in Valencia on java applications for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, New York and London.
     In the Spring of 2007 he moved to CSD, where he met Paco, and where he was director of technical operations for the UK office as well as leading and consulting on a variety of Java, Ruby and PHP projects in both the Spanish public and private sectors.
     Hugh left CSD in September, 2009 to set up Gilmation.</p>
     <h4>Current Focus</h4>
     <p>For over 5 years, until April 2016, Hugh combined the role of IT Director at AFG Media, where he had a minority shareholding and a seat on the board, with the continued development of the Gilmation businesses.
     After moving back to Scotland in July 2015, he is now actively focused on Gilmation's existing clients and developing new opportunities.
     When not working with clients or on his businesses, Hugh dedicates his time to his family, spending time outdoors and sports - which helps with the continual struggle to stay fit !</p>
